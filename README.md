# Personal Project

I have created a simple SchoolPlanner application using Java that allows the user to manage classes, tasks and events, and textbooks. This application is tailored to students at the University of British Columbia so it may not work effectively for students in other locations. 

The key technologies used in this project are: Java, JUnit (for testing), and Java Swing (for GUI development). There is a lot of work that could be done to further refine this project but the project is functional and does most of the basic tasks. 

The application allows the user to do the following things:
:arrow_forward: Add classes.
:arrow_forward: Add tasks and events.
:arrow_forward: Add textbooks to a class.
:arrow_forward: Remove tasks and events.
:arrow_forward: Remove textbooks from a class.
:arrow_forward: Remove classes.
:arrow_forward: View all items that are stored in the application.

This is a project that may be updated in the future with more functionality but for now, this is as far as I will go.
